# Land of Lisp
These are my exercises from the book Land of Lisp. I make use of lisp-unit to test my solutions.

## usage
Open `REPL` in any folder where the file you want to run is located by running the following:

    clisp

Once the it's up type the following into the `REPL`:

    (load "filename.lisp")
