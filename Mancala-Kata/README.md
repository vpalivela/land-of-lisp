##Basic Mancala

1. Mancala is a two player game where each person takes turns "sowing" seeds from well to well.
Here is an example of a mancala playing field:

2. Each player has 6 wells and a well that is considered a goal, each well starts off with 4 seeds.  Goal wells do not have any seeds.

3. Each player sows seeds counter clockwise from well to well, 
picking up all seeds from the source well and dropping one seed into each well after.  
The player's goal well is included in the sowing process.  
The opponent's wells are also included in the sowing processes.  
The opponent's goal well is NOT included in the sowing process.

4. The game ends when any one player has no seeds to sow from his wells on his turn (players cannot sow from their goal well).

5. The winner is determined by how may seeds exist in each player's goal well 
and how many seeds exist in the sowing wells on each player's side.  
The player with the most seeds in his wells PLUS his goal well wins.

##Egyptian Mancala

1. All the rules of basic mancala apply.

2. When sowing seeds, if the LAST seed in the sowing process lands in his goal well, the player gets another turn.

3. When sowing seeds, if the LAST seed lands in an EMPTY well, 
he gets to take all the seeds from the opponent's well directly opposite 
of that well and place all seeds into his goal well,
along with the single seed that caused the capture).
